            Photosynthesis is a process used by plants and other organisms to convert <br>
            light energy into chemical energy that can later be released to fuel the <br>
            organisms' activities. This chemical energy is stored in carbohydrate <br>
            molecules, such as sugars, which are synthesized from carbon dioxide <br>
            and water – hence the name photosynthesis, from the Greek φῶς, phōs, <br>
            "light", and σύνθεσις, synthesis, "putting together". <br>

            In most
            cases, oxygen is also released as a waste product. Most plants, <br>
            most algae, and cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis; such organisms <br>
            are called photoautotrophs. Photosynthesis is largely responsible for <br>
            producing and maintaining the oxygen content of the Earth's atmosphere, <br>
            and supplies all of the organic compounds and most of the energy necessary <br>
            for life on Earth. <br>

            In photosynthetic bacteria, the proteins that gather light for photosynthesis <br>
            are embedded in cell membranes. In its simplest form, this involves the membrane <br>
            surrounding the cell itself. However, the membrane may be tightly folded into <br>
            cylindrical sheets called thylakoids, or bunched up into round vesicles called <br>
            intracytoplasmic membranes. These structures can fill most of the interior <br>
            of a cell, giving the membrane a very large surface area and therefore increasing <br>
            the amount of light that the bacteria can absorb. <br>
