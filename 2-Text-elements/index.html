    <h1><b1>What is Lorem Ipsum?</b1></h1>
    <p><b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</p>
    <p>
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
        <br>
        scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining
        <br>
        essentially unchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
        It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
        <br>
        publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

    <h1><b>Cascading Style Sheets</b></h1>
    <p>
        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language
        <br>
        like HTML. 
    </p>
    <p>
        CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name <i>cascading</i> comes from the specified priority scheme to determine which style rule applies if more than one rule matches a
        <br>
        particular element. This cascading <b>priority</b> scheme is predictable.
