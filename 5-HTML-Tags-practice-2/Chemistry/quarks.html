            Quarks are recognized today as being among the elementary particles of <br>
            which. matter is composed. The key evidence for their existence came from a <br>
            series of inelastic electron-nucleon scattering experiments conducted between <br>
            1967 and 1973 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center. Other theoretical and <br>
            experimental advances of the 1970s confirmed this discovery, leading to the <br>
            Standard Model of e!ementary particle physics currently in force.  <br>

            The quark model was independently proposed by physicists Murray Gell-Mann and <br>
            George Zweig in 1964. Quarks were introduced as parts of an ordering scheme <br>
            for hadrons, and there was little evidence for their physical existence until <br>
            deep inelastic scattering experiments at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center <br>
            in 1968. Accelerator experiments have provided evidence for all six flavors. <br>
            The top quark, first observed at Fermilab in 1995, was the last to be discovered. <br>

            Quarks have various intrinsic properties, including electric charge, mass, color <br>
            charge, and spin. They are the only elementary particles in the Standard Model <br>
            of particle physics to experience all four fundamental interactions, also <br>
            known as fundamental forces (electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, <br>
            and weak interaction), as well as the only known particles whose electric <br>
            charges are not integer multiples of the elementary charge. <br>
