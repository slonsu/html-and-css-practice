            Space Shuttle Endeavour (Orbiter Vehicle Designation: OV-105) is a <br>
            retired orbiter from NASA's Space Shuttle program and the fifth and <br>
            final operational Shuttle built. It embarked on its first mission, <br>
            STS-49, in May 1992 and its 25th and final mission, STS-134, in May <br>
            2011.[1][2][3] STS-134 was expected to be the final mission of the <br>
            Space Shuttle program,[4] but with the authorization of STS-135, <br>
            Atlantis became the last shuttle to fly. <br>

            The United States Congress approved the construction of Endeavour in <br>
            1987 to replace Challenger, which was destroyed in 1986. <br>

            Structural spares built during the construction of Discovery and <br>
            Atlantis were used in its assembly. NASA chose, on cost grounds, <br>
            to build Endeavour from spares rather than refitting Enterprise or <br>
            accepting a Rockwell International proposal to build two Shuttles <br>
            for the price of one. <br>
